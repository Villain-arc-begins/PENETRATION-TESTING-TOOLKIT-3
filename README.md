## Overview of the Project
This project is a **PENETRATION TESTING TOOLKIT**, it combines both the directory brute-forcing and port scanning into a single Python-based toolkit. It is designed for penetration testers to discover potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in web applications and servers.
## key features
**1. Vulnerability Discovery Automation:**

Process the finding of a wordlist to access open directories or files on a web server.
Check for wrongly configured or lost endpoints that are prone to disclosing sensitive information.

**2. Port Scanning for Network Security:**

List open ports to find potential attack entry points on a target server
Identify unused or non-essential services that should be secured or turned off

**3. Holistic Testing**

Provide a tool to scan both the application and network layers of a target system.
Enable users to add file extensions and test specific ports for better customization.

**4. User-Friendly Operation:**

The tool must allow the user to customize the scan using arguments such as wordlists, target URLs, file extensions, and port lists.
The tool should be flexible and easy to integrate into penetration testing workflows.

**5. Practical Real-World Application:**

The tool can demonstrate how brute-forcing and port scanning can be used to find security gaps in systems.
Provide actionable results that can be used to improve server hardening and network security.
